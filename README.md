# Anomaly Detection System using LSTM Autoencoder

This project implements a deep learning-based anomaly detection pipeline designed for early fault detection and system health monitoring in spacecraft telemetry or any time series system.

It uses:

1.LSTM Autoencoder for unsupervised learning of normal patterns

2.Anomaly score generation via reconstruction error

3.Label-based anomaly injection for simulation and benchmarking

##  How It Works

üîß Step 1: Data Loading and Parsing
Time series data is simulated per telemetry channel (sine wave + noise).

Anomalies from labels_cleaned.csv are injected into the signal for realism.

üßº Step 2: Preprocessing
Data is scaled using MinMaxScaler.

Sliding window sequences are created for training (e.g., 30-timestep windows).

Only "normal" sequences (outside labeled anomaly windows) are used for training.

üß† Step 3: LSTM Autoencoder
The model learns to reconstruct normal sequences.

On unseen data, it reconstructs normal well and fails on anomalies.

Reconstruction error (MSE) is used as the Anomaly Score.

üîç Step 4: Anomaly Detection
A dynamic threshold (95th percentile) is applied to flag anomalies.

Binary prediction:
0 = Normal
1 = Anomaly
