# Anomaly Detection System using LSTM Autoencoder

This project implements a deep learning-based anomaly detection pipeline designed for early fault detection and system health monitoring in spacecraft telemetry or any time series system.

It uses:

LSTM Autoencoder for unsupervised learning of normal patterns

Anomaly score generation via reconstruction error

Label-based anomaly injection for simulation and benchmarking
